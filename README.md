ðŸ§  NLP Projects â€“ Sentiment Analysis & Duplicate Question Detection

Welcome to the NLP Projects repository! This repository contains two major Natural Language Processing projects developed in Python: 

Sentiment Analyzer â€“ An end-to-end NLP pipeline that predicts sentiment using techniques like Word2Vec, feature engineering, and machine learning. Duplicate Question Detection â€“ A semantic similarity detection system using textual features, fuzzy logic, and classification algorithms trained on datasets like Quora. Both projects demonstrate the core strengths of NLP in solving real-world text understanding problems.
